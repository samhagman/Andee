Unknown Speaker  
Or like, okay for the weather.

Sam Hagman  
Okay, so you want so so before we get to where you're talking about, though, can you come back? Are you sneezing more?

Okay, no, I met inside of the I'm asking questions about how you want it to work. Like, imagine it goes beyond just weather or whatever. Like, I'm just saying, if I let's say that we're asking for, like, a weather report for the weekend, right? Right? That response, I can write text like, I can write plain text back and just and to have it respond like a like, as if, like, as if we had, like, an intern, right? That's just gonna text us back, the weather, but, but inside the message box, it only has access to sending text and images and like emojis or whatever, right? But if I have a button, I can launch a full website where I can make it look and do anything, yeah, I mean, so I can build anything in that report, like I can duplicate this exact UI if we wanted to, but I can't have it just appear. I wish I could right. Like, I wish that I could ask that question, and then this whole box that's like gray will give you would just be exactly that. But I can't. I need to have someone click something else. Like, does that make sense? So, so I was thinking, maybe what we do is like the response. It gives like a like. Do you see how like this is like some text that's like this. It uses the the the chat response to give, like, a summary, and then there's like, a, you know, order food, which then opens up a larger thing. So what if the pattern, so, isn't just for the weather, it's for, like, everything. And I'm just looking for like, a pattern to start to, like, start with is, what if, like, you asked, like, what's the weather for the weekend? And then it would say, like, things look good, although it's going to be snowing a little bit. And then this says, like, open full report. If you click that, then, then I could basically write a full customization where we wanted, like, hey, like, if we ask about the weekend, then customize this to just be about the whole weekend and talk about things that we care about, right? Like, oh, like, it's gonna rain in the afternoon, so make sure to go outside in the morning. You know, I mean, like, because it'll, like, know our preferences when it writes the report. So when you ask for something, it gives like a snippet to give you a hint about what to do in here. Does that make sense?

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah, maybe interesting to kind of like they can tell me what to wear, yeah.

Sam Hagman  
Okay, so does that make sense, though of what I mean? Yeah, I wish I could get more examples of

Unknown Speaker  
you tell me what you say now, tell me what you say if you cannot stay down.

Unknown Speaker  
Okay.

Sam Hagman  
So, like, is that a good pattern? Though? You think so. Is there any other option? So, what's this one? Coffee? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  
so she.

Unknown Speaker  
There was a maybe.

Unknown Speaker  
It was in here, fly away. Traffic those examples of how to Do it you

Speaker 1  
you The other option is I can, like, totally.

Sam Hagman  
I think so. I think there needs to be a button so it could be a link inside of it, too, instead just one button, like, for example, if, if you asked for like, three reports, then it could give you, like, three links or something. I um,

that's probably the only real options. Or I could just respond. I could put the full thing in text. I don't have to make a UI like it doesn't have to have nice prettiness, it could just respond all in text, although I feel like that's kind of lame, but I Don't know. What do you think?

Speaker 2  
Can you, like, give me reminders right away of the temperature when I open

Sam Hagman  
so I think what I would do is that, Oh, you mean, like, when you open it, it just has the temperature. Yes. Well, what I was thinking is that in the morning, at 6am it just sent us a, like a, like a, like a daily report for the day. Like I was trying to show you this one other time, but like, this is what I'm doing for work. So for work, I'm having it generate me, like, I call it a Presidential Daily Brief. I'm just kind of because, you know, like, the President gets like a brief every day. So, like, that's what I was thinking, is like, what's our Presidential Daily Brief? So, like, it tells me what's on my calendar for the day, and then it gives me, like, notes around what I should prep for based on past conversations. It tells me what I need to do, like, what are the my most important priorities for the day? And then it tells me of, like, important stuff that occurred. And then it like it has more of my exact tasks, of everything that I have to do I have, like things called like rituals, which is like things I want to do every day or every week or every month, and it attracts what day it is and if I want to do that ritual. And so it tells me those things for the day, and then I get an overview of all the active projects that are happening across the company, and what is kind of happening like today, and what the status is, and then upcoming stuff that's going to be coming up. And then it looks at all of the customers that I care about, and it gives me the stage that they're currently in. So this is all the customers. This is their stage, and this is like the notes of what's happening with them, same with the partners versus a different kind of customer. I'm also doing like a competitive I'm doing like this is not working well, but it's like a intelligence. Briefer every day of like what's happening in industry, but it's too generic, and then tells me about things that happen with our customers. I This is all very duplicative right now. It doesn't make it nice and pretty, but you, you, you get the idea, right. Here's all the highlights from Slack channels. I um, yeah, so, so you get the gist, right? So I'm thinking about every morning at six or am, or whatever it just, it'll just send us both our own or like a group one, when you start with that, right? So they can both sit. So it'll send us both a like a thing, and we can just say, like, look at our like, brief, or whatever, you know, like. So the message says, like, hey, you know, like, it gives, it gives, like, an executive, like, summary here, and then this is like, you know, open my daily brief next, right? And that opens up a full window that can just be a custom, like, have, like, the weather and everything inside of it. Does that make sense? So they have the weather in it, for example, is there? So you want the weather, and you said you care about what the like you want, like the accurate weather, and you want the range. So you want the range and the hourly, no just doing so you don't care what the hourly, okay, it's fine, because I want the hourly, so okay, but it

Unknown Speaker  
works. And if it's gonna rain, what time

Sam Hagman  
got it? So if there's going to be some kind of, like, change in the weather. And by changing the weather, it's like, you mean like, like, rain, sleet, snow, whatever. And why do we Why do we want that Sure? Like, what's the good description of why you want to know when it's gonna start raining so I

Speaker 2  
know if I need to bring umbrella or not. Okay, will it rain after seven? It might be rain after seven. That's great. I'm not gonna bring my umbrella if it rains before five. I need to go home, so I need my umbrella, makes sense?

Sam Hagman  
And then the range is for how warm to be, huh? The the range is, like, what kind of dress you should do,

Unknown Speaker  
what kind of tools I should bring? Well, no, no.

Speaker 1  
But like, also you're saying about telling you what to wear, yeah, so, like, the range,

Speaker 2  
exactly, the range is below minus five Celsius. I need to know, I need to layer four layers, if it ranges up above minus five, which is like warmer than minus five. I need two more. Okay?

Sam Hagman  
Makes sense? No, no, that makes sense. Makes sense to me. Okay, so we want to so the weather report, so in the brief, it should be like, I suggest X number of layers and, like, an umbrella or whatever. Yeah, okay, got it. I like that, yeah, I like when it's gonna rain, or when, when it's gonna when it's gonna rain, or when it's gonna be, like, Sunny. Because I also want to know when to go for a walk. Like, if you get to choose your lunch time, is it? Is it like, nice to go and it's like, sunny out, yeah, but it probably takes a lot of effort, so you don't really think about it all the time. But if the report said, grab your lunch around noon because it'll be sunny, that might be helpful, exactly.

Speaker 2  
But it also, the report says it's gonna rain at two. If I need the lemon at Star market. I know I need to go,

Sam Hagman  
yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you probably want to be updated if the weather is different than the report, yeah. So like, every maybe, like, every hour it can check if the weather is different than what the report said in the morning, and then send you an like, and then send us a ping, saying, Hey, by the way, the weather is now different, so like, it's gonna rain at XYZ time instead, so that we make sure we get our alert, because we might have planned something around that, right? Okay, that makes sense. Okay. I like that. Those all make sense. So I think what I'll do is I'll make like, a generic, like weather tool. So if we ask about the weather, it knows all of what we're talking about. So we say, hey, like, what's the weather over the weekend? Then it's like, oh, you know. That's like, it's gonna rain at noon. So make sure that you get anything you want to get done, done in the morning or whatever, you know. And so there's like a generic like so the way to think about it, by the way, is there's like skills. So the agent has a skill. So the agent has the the AI agent has two things. They have skills that will they have more than this. I'm just gonna explain right now, they have skills and tools. So it's like a tool is like a hammer. A skill is knowing how to how to hang a picture, right?

Speaker 1  
So the skill, so it will have a skill called, like, um,

Sam Hagman  
explaining to us the weather, you know, I'll say the weather skill, right? And it's basically like, if we're ever asking about the weather, then here's how to think about the weather for us. Like, basically, again, it's like having, like, like an intern, like assistant. We would like tell them all of this stuff about how we care about the weather, and then they would just know, based on what the weather is, how to like what's important to us. And then they would tell us that stuff. Yeah, that makes sense. And so then, so that's the weather skill, and then eventually we'll have, like, the daily brief skill, and that will just come and basically that will say, hey, in the mornings we we care about the weather and about any of the reminders that we want to set for the day, right? And so then it goes, Okay. Well, now to make my report in the morning, we care about the weather. Well, I'll go check my skill about the weather first, because that's the thing that that understands the weather, so that it goes and reads the skill about the weather, and then it goes, Okay, here's the weather that I need to explain about. And then in the future, we'll have a other skill called, like, to do list management skill. And that skill goes, Okay, here's where I throw all their tasks. Here's how their tasks are formatted, here's what they care about for tasks. And it goes, Okay, great. Now I can go look up their tasks, and then it'll come back and put it all together in the report. So it's like, very flexible, you know, I mean, so you have to, like, decompose it into pieces that are like reusable, and then they could kind of like, mesh together. Does that make sense? A little bit, like, does it actually make sense? Or am I just saying random shit? Do shit licks make sense? That's a mix. It's important because I'll keep explaining it, but it helps me when you're asking for stuff, I can be like, Okay, that's gonna go in the weather skill. That's gonna go in the daily report, skill, or whatever. Anyways, okay, so then for the weather, going back to that right, for what to wear, what are the rules you have for that in your head? So you said, if it's less than five, if it'll range less than five, you want four layers

Unknown Speaker  
less than five, doing warmer or colder. If

Sam Hagman  
it's less than five degrees Celsius,

Speaker 2  
this is minus five degrees in my head. If it's less than if it's more than minus five degrees, which is cooler, colder?

Sam Hagman  
Oh, that's weird. No, going up is more

Speaker 2  
if it's more than minus five degrees, which means it's colder. Oh, God, super cold on me.

Speaker 1  
Okay, so can you say less than five degrees

Speaker 2  
because it's a absolute last is minus five, minus six, minus seven, right?

Sam Hagman  
Yes. So you can't say more, because then that's

Speaker 2  
less than minus five degrees, which means it's gonna be colder. Yeah, it's gonna be super cold. So I need to wear turtleneck plus sweater, so it's gonna be two long sleeve. Okay, got it. There's an upper layer and an absolute scarf. But if it's less than minus five degree,

Sam Hagman  
if it's more or less, no, it's more than five degrees. So if it's if it's warmer than five degrees, it's

Speaker 2  
warmer than minus five degrees. Yeah, yeah. Minus five degrees, that means I probably don't need a scarf, and I can wear one short sleeve and one long sleeve, okay.

Speaker 1  
And then, and then, when. Do you switch, usually, to only wearing one

Speaker 2  
layer off top, one layer would be above one degree,

Sam Hagman  
okay, warmer than one degree, yeah, warmer than one degree. And then when do you wear the the pants under your pants, always when it's so wets 20 degrees, yeah, but that's saying the range, yeah. Like, when do you think you'd put it on

Speaker 2  
10 degrees and lower? 10 degrees and colder, 10

Sam Hagman  
degrees and colder, you would wear the Yeah, 10 degrees and lower and Celsius. You would wear the double pants, the pants under your pants. Okay, got it, got it. Yeah. And for your shoes. When do you wear boots versus like so if it's raining or snowing or sleeting, so if there's like precipitation happening, then you want to wear boots, okay? And you need to bring an umbrella. Well, if it's snowing, you don't bring an umbrella, though, right? So if there's a chance of rain or sleet, right? Is everything okay? Is that yes or no? What? No, you just need to talk. So I know
